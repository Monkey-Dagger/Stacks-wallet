# Stacks-wallet

SwiftUI based iOS and watchOS app for querying blockchain data via the Covalent API. I made wallet app for listing token balances, NFTs and searching for transactions on a perticular wallet network and address.

## TestFlight - Testing iOS and watchOS app.

## Built With ðŸ› 
- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/) - SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift.
- [Realm](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/ios/) - The MongoDB Realm Swift SDK enables mobile applications to access data stored in local realms.

## Features:
- fetch and filter token balances
- get NFT data
- Smart contract transaction info

App architecture:
- MVVM design

Remaining (watchOS):
- Redesign watchOS to match iOS design feature
- Add navigation to transactions to show complete transaction details we get from covalent.
- Selection of multiple addresses is not complete due to hackathon as this was my first time making a watchOS app using swiftUI.
